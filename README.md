# EmaPay - Clean Financial Platform

A clean, simple financial platform built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Clerk authentication, and Supabase database. **This project has been completely cleaned of over-engineering and is ready for a simple 15-endpoint API implementation.**

## 🧹 **CLEANUP COMPLETED**

This project was previously over-engineered with 200+ API endpoints, domain-driven design, complex middleware, and 150+ test files. **All bloat has been removed** and the project now has a clean foundation ready for simple, effective implementation.

### ✅ **What Was Removed:**
- ❌ 200+ over-engineered API endpoints
- ❌ Domain-driven design structure (domain/, application/, presentation/)
- ❌ Complex middleware and infrastructure abstractions
- ❌ 150+ fraud detection test files
- ❌ Over-engineered validation and security theater
- ❌ Unnecessary architectural complexity

### ✅ **What Was Preserved:**
- ✅ Clean Next.js 15 app structure
- ✅ Essential UI components (shadcn/ui + custom)
- ✅ Core database schema (10+ tables and functions)
- ✅ Clerk authentication integration
- ✅ Supabase database connection
- ✅ Essential utilities and validation
- ✅ Clean TypeScript configuration

Create `.env.local` with your Clerk and Supabase credentials:
```bash
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret

# Supabase Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

3. **Run the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Database Schema

**Core Tables:**
- `users` - User management with Clerk integration
- `wallets` - Multi-currency balance tracking
- `transactions` - Transaction history and status
- `kyc_records` - Identity verification data
- `order_book` - Trading orders (EUR/AOA)
- `trades` - Completed trade records
- `fees` - Fee configuration
- `security_audit_log` - Security event tracking

## Next Steps: Simple API Implementation

This clean foundation is ready for a **simple 15-endpoint API** that serves real user needs:

### Planned API Endpoints (15 total):
1. **Authentication** (3): Login, logout, refresh token
2. **User Management** (2): Get profile, update profile
3. **Wallet Operations** (3): Get balances, deposit, withdraw
4. **Transactions** (4): Send money, get history, get details, cancel
5. **KYC Process** (2): Submit documents, get status
6. **Trading** (1): Get exchange rates

### Design Principles

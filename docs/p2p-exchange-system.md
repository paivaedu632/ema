# EmaPay Peer-to-Peer Exchange System

## Overview

The EmaPay P2P Exchange System allows users to create currency exchange offers and trade directly with other users. This system replaces immediate transactions with a marketplace-style approach where users can set their own exchange rates within acceptable limits.

## Architecture Changes

### Database Schema Updates

#### 1. New `offers` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE offers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  currency_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (currency_type IN ('AOA', 'EUR')),
  reserved_amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL CHECK (reserved_amount > 0),
  exchange_rate DECIMAL(10,6) NOT NULL CHECK (exchange_rate > 0),
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'completed', 'cancelled')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
);
```

**Purpose**: Stores peer-to-peer currency exchange offers with reserved balance management.

**Key Fields**:
- `user_id`: Reference to the user who created the offer
- `currency_type`: Currency being offered for sale (AOA or EUR)
- `reserved_amount`: Amount of currency reserved for this offer
- `exchange_rate`: Exchange rate set by the seller
- `status`: Offer status (active, completed, cancelled)

#### 2. Updated `wallets` Table
- **Removed**: `reserved_balance` column
- **Retained**: `available_balance` column only
- **Rationale**: Reserved balances are now managed through the offers table

#### 3. New `wallet_balances_with_reserved` View
```sql
CREATE VIEW wallet_balances_with_reserved AS
SELECT 
    w.user_id,
    w.currency,
    w.available_balance,
    COALESCE(o.reserved_balance, 0.00) as reserved_balance,
    w.available_balance + COALESCE(o.reserved_balance, 0.00) as total_balance,
    w.created_at,
    w.updated_at
FROM wallets w
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        currency_type as currency,
        SUM(reserved_amount) as reserved_balance
    FROM offers 
    WHERE status = 'active'
    GROUP BY user_id, currency_type
) o ON w.user_id = o.user_id AND w.currency = o.currency;
```

**Purpose**: Provides backward compatibility by calculating reserved balances from active offers.

### Database Functions

#### 1. Exchange Rate Validation
```sql
validate_exchange_rate(currency_code TEXT, proposed_rate DECIMAL(10,6)) RETURNS BOOLEAN
```
- Validates rates against existing market offers (20% margin)
- Falls back to Banco BAI API baseline (50% margin) if no offers exist

#### 2. Offer Management
```sql
create_currency_offer(user_uuid UUID, currency_code TEXT, amount_to_reserve DECIMAL(15,2), rate DECIMAL(10,6)) RETURNS UUID
cancel_currency_offer(offer_uuid UUID, user_uuid UUID) RETURNS BOOLEAN
```
- Atomic operations for creating and cancelling offers
- Automatic balance management between available and reserved

#### 3. Balance Queries
```sql
get_user_reserved_balance(user_uuid UUID, currency_code TEXT) RETURNS DECIMAL(15,2)
get_user_total_balance(user_uuid UUID, currency_code TEXT) RETURNS DECIMAL(15,2)
check_available_balance(user_uuid UUID, currency_code TEXT, required_amount DECIMAL(15,2)) RETURNS BOOLEAN
```

## Exchange Rate Logic

### 1. Market-Based Validation (Primary)
- **Source**: Existing active offers from last 24 hours
- **Margin**: ±20% of average market rate
- **Priority**: Used when market offers exist

### 2. API Baseline Validation (Fallback)
- **Source**: Banco BAI API (https://ib.bancobai.ao/portal/api/internet/exchange/table)
- **Margin**: ±50% of API baseline rate
- **Priority**: Used when no market offers exist

### 3. Rate Conversion Logic
```typescript
// AOA to EUR rate (use sellValue as baseline)
aoaToEurRate = 1 / bancoBaiData.sellValue

// EUR to AOA rate (use buyValue as baseline)  
eurToAoaRate = bancoBaiData.buyValue
```

## API Changes

### Updated `/api/transactions/sell` Endpoint

**Before**: Created immediate transactions
**After**: Creates marketplace offers

#### Request Format
```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "exchangeRate": 0.001082,
  "currency": "AOA"
}
```

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "offer_id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid", 
    "currency": "AOA",
    "amount": 1000,
    "exchange_rate": 0.001082,
    "status": "active",
    "created_at": "2025-06-20T12:00:00Z",
    "validation_info": {
      "source": "market_offers",
      "market_rate": 0.001080,
      "allowed_range": {
        "min": 0.000864,
        "max": 0.001296
      }
    }
  },
  "message": "Oferta de venda criada com sucesso"
}
```

### Updated `/api/wallet/balances` Endpoint

**Before**: Fetched from wallets table directly
**After**: Uses `wallet_balances_with_reserved` view

#### Response Format (Unchanged)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "currency": "AOA",
      "available_balance": 5000.00,
      "reserved_balance": 1000.00,
      "last_updated": "2025-06-20T12:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "currency": "EUR", 
      "available_balance": 100.00,
      "reserved_balance": 0.00,
      "last_updated": "2025-06-20T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Changes

### Dashboard UI Updates
- **Maintained**: 4-card layout (2 per currency)
- **Card Types**: "Conta" (available) and "Reservado" (reserved)
- **Data Source**: Updated to use new API response format
- **Compatibility**: No visual changes required

### Sell Flow Updates
- **Process**: Amount → Rate Type → Manual Rate (if selected) → Confirmation → Success
- **Success Message**: "Venda publicada!" (Sale published!)
- **New Feature**: Share functionality for published offers
- **Backend**: Creates offers instead of immediate transactions

## TypeScript Types

### New Types
```typescript
export type Offer = Database['public']['Tables']['offers']['Row']
export type OfferInsert = Database['public']['Tables']['offers']['Insert'] 
export type OfferUpdate = Database['public']['Tables']['offers']['Update']

export type WalletBalanceWithReserved = Database['public']['Views']['wallet_balances_with_reserved']['Row']
```

### Updated Types
```typescript
// Removed reserved_balance from wallets table types
export type Wallet = {
  available_balance: number
  created_at: string | null
  currency: string
  id: string
  updated_at: string | null
  user_id: string | null
}
```

## Utility Functions

### Exchange Rate Validation (`src/utils/exchange-rate-validation.ts`)
```typescript
// Main validation function
validateExchangeRate(currencyType: 'AOA' | 'EUR', proposedRate: number): Promise<ExchangeRateValidationResult>

// Helper functions
getMarketRateFromOffers(currencyType: 'AOA' | 'EUR'): Promise<number | null>
getBaselineRateFromAPI(currencyType: 'AOA' | 'EUR'): Promise<number | null>
fetchBancoBaiExchangeRate(): Promise<BancoBaiApiResponse | null>
getSuggestedExchangeRateRange(currencyType: 'AOA' | 'EUR'): Promise<RangeInfo | null>
```

### Supabase Helper Functions (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
```typescript
// Offer management
getUserOffers(userId: string, status?: string)
getActiveOffers(currencyType?: string)
createOffer(userId: string, currencyType: string, amount: number, exchangeRate: number)
cancelOffer(offerId: string, userId: string)

// Balance queries
getUserTotalBalance(userId: string, currency: string)
```

## Migration Files

1. **`20250620120000_create_offers_table_p2p_exchange.sql`**
   - Creates offers table with proper schema
   - Adds indexes for performance
   - Creates RLS policies
   - Implements helper functions

2. **`20250620130000_migrate_reserved_balance_to_offers.sql`**
   - Migrates existing reserved balances to offers table
   - Removes reserved_balance column from wallets
   - Creates compatibility view
   - Updates validation functions

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Public Access**: Users can view all active offers (marketplace browsing)
- **Private Access**: Users can view/modify only their own offers
- **Audit Trail**: Offers are cancelled, not deleted

### Data Validation
- **Exchange Rates**: Validated against market/API baselines
- **Balance Checks**: Atomic operations prevent overselling
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs validated before database operations

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
```sql
-- Primary indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_offers_user_id ON offers (user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_offers_currency_type ON offers (currency_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_offers_status ON offers (status);

-- Composite indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_offers_currency_status ON offers (currency_type, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_offers_active_by_rate ON offers (currency_type, exchange_rate) WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Exchange Rates**: 24-hour window for market rate calculations
- **API Calls**: Banco BAI API calls with 10-second timeout
- **View Materialization**: Consider materializing wallet_balances_with_reserved for high traffic

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create offer with valid exchange rate
- [ ] Verify balance moves from available to reserved
- [ ] Test exchange rate validation (market and API)
- [ ] Cancel offer and verify balance restoration
- [ ] Dashboard displays correct available/reserved balances
- [ ] Sell flow creates offers instead of transactions

### API Testing
- [ ] POST `/api/transactions/sell` with various rates
- [ ] GET `/api/wallet/balances` shows updated balances
- [ ] Error handling for insufficient balance
- [ ] Error handling for invalid exchange rates

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
1. **Offer Matching**: Automatic matching of buy/sell offers
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket notifications for offer status
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Search offers by rate, amount, user rating
4. **Escrow System**: Secure fund holding during transactions
5. **Rating System**: User reputation based on successful trades

### Performance Improvements
1. **Materialized Views**: For frequently accessed balance calculations
2. **Background Jobs**: Periodic cleanup of expired offers
3. **Rate Caching**: Cache Banco BAI API responses
4. **Pagination**: For large offer lists
